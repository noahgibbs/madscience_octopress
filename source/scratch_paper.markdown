This ebook costs $50 -- for now.  It will get more expensive.  Later,
you’ll probably have to pay some company for hosting (except the
initial free EC2 time).

There will also be interviews and supplemental material —
extra information from people who build a lot of the tools you’ll be
using.  If you buy now, you’ll get a nice discount on those things
later, if you want it.  Or you can wait, and everything gets more
expensive.
