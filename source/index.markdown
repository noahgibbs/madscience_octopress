Just putting it off? Writing more features &mdash; or more apps &mdash; to avoid that next step?

Or you put together a horrible one-off "special snowflake" server, and you hope like
hell it <b>never goes down</b>. You tried building a test server and stopped using it after a week, because
it has a whole different set of weird bugs.

{% imgcap right /images/deploy_tag_cloud.png 350 129 How Many of These Are Required? %}

Once in awhile you install one more tool and hope it helps. Some are fun, but none really fix the problem, right?

You tried. You read through <i>Rails guides,
ancient blog posts</i> and many, many forums of
<b><i>"just rewrite everything in my favorite tool!"</i></b>

Also, most of the blog posts are flat-out wrong. Capistrano 3, Puppet 3, Chef 11,
they all <b>break backward compatibility. A lot.</b> If a blog post is old,
it's wrong. And most of them aren't labeled, and don't say what version.

<b>Or your deploy system mostly works... And then breaks.</b>

You push a new version out. Things break. Sometimes they stay broken for days. Or weeks.

Want to get rid of that <b>DREAD</b> of deployment?

## What If Deploys Felt Good? And Just Worked?

{% img pull-right /images/GoogleRubyDeployment.png 270 400 "A familiar sight" "What you see when you start Googling Ruby Deployment" %}

What if deploying all your apps was easy and reliable? What if you just added the
app to a file, ran tests and then pushed to production, all in ten minutes?

What if it was easy to test new versions quietly, then push them
out when they work?

What if you could write a new app and have it <i>up and running the
same day</i> and feel <i>confident that it worked?</i>

And what if you could join a group of people who knew deployment and could help you with
your problems with it?

## But... How?

I'd like you to use my class and software.
The software takes your app from "only on my machine" to "on the Internet and
anybody can use it." It'll take you an hour the first time you put a simple
app online.

You get:

<ul>
  <li>Your application deployed to a virtual machine, then to production. Two-command deploys.</li>
  <li>Tools that install <b>everything you need</b> to a local VM.</li>
  <li>Simple instructions to drop your own app in, even if it needs custom libraries or daemons.</li>
  <li>Solid, simple monitoring for your app</li>
  <li>A pain-free initial process, then troubleshooting and customization when you want.</li>
  <li>Documentation to take you from &quot;I know Ruby&quot; to &quot;I can use these tools.&quot;</li>
  <li>Pointers on where next, if you need to get to mastery with the tools; most people will never need it.</li>
</ul>

You'll get the "I NEED IT DEPLOYED NOW" fast instructions with minimal theory, <b>plus</b> a
slower path that teaches you what the tools do and why &mdash;
deep knowledge for developers who like to know how everything ticks.

{% blockquote Yehuda Katz, (about <a href="http://rebuilding-rails.com">Rebuilding Rails</a>) %}
I saw your talk at Gogaruco. It was fun!

Your methodology maps onto how I like to learn things: from the ground up from first principles.

## Praise for Rebuilding Rails by Noah Gibbs

Rebuilding Rails has been chosen as the subject of a class at the University of Washington,
several different Rails bootcamps and Satish Talim's RubyLearning.com class. It has been
the subject of Ruby conference presentations by Guille Carlos and Nishant Modak,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh5MYvNXt0A" target="_blank">plus my own</a>.

{% blockquote Satish Talim https://www.facebook.com/rubylearning/posts/10151644050623920 RubyLearning.com %}
This is a must-have book for anyone seriously planning to work or working in Sinatra, Rails.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote Eli Riter %}
Okay, damn you, you win!  I'll buy the book: the exercises are just too
good. [...] You write as though your audience has minimal knowledge
and limitless intelligence.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote David Baynes %}
Thanks, Noah! Really jacked to read this highly recommended book by my teachers
at University of Washington.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote Kirk Quesnelle %}
What drew my attention to your book was that [...] I'm the type of
developer that likes to know how things tick at a very deep level.
The guy who messed with Assembler but knew he didn't have to. I'm not a huge
fan of magic when it comes to programming for the fact that when you get
into trouble with code or find yourself in a complex edge case, or even a
bug, knowing more about what's going on "behind the scenes" is very
helpful.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote Brian Cameron %}
I found your book there a while back and finally over Christmas I've had
some time to work through it. It's satisfying a whole load of curiosities
that I had and I'm learning and clarifying a lot of things. In fact, I'm
like a kid in a candy store. It's so nice to be spoon fed this info as
it's a lot of work to dig it out all by oneself.

It was the perfect Christmas present to myself ;-)

Your flow and pedagogic style is just excellent, always dropping in some
neat tricks along side the main topic.
