How much of your well-crafted, beautiful code never gets used?

{% img right /images/hasnt_retweeted_600.png 600 247 "Oh, I guess he's too pretty to tweet right now." "Igor says: Brad Pitt has not retweeted his favorite products with our app, master!" %}

How much of your code never even ships?  It’s on a computer somewhere,
but nobody else can use it?

How many hours, days or years of your life have drained away on things
nobody ever even tries out?

You might have a LinkedIn clone for mad scientists and
assistants to meet up in your GitHub repo.  Or an app for sorting
terabytes of data.  Or plain AI software for rampaging monsters --
everything is now software-intensive.  But most of your code isn’t
doing a thing.  It could.  But it isn’t.

People won't come to your GitHub account and try out the random
things you leave there unused.  If you don't use it, neither will
they.  And how much
of your code even makes it that far?


## What If You Could Change the World Today?

Imagine your code being available, testable, and <b>usable</b>
immediately.  As quickly as you get it working, you could just send
out a link to it.  Igors could sign up for your LinkedIn clone.
People could submit a gigabyte or two of test data to your signal
extractor.  Monster-builders could download your new firmware with the
latest rampage patterns… Instantly.

What if you were seen, linked to and cheered on?  Every development
week, every day, every hour could make a different.  What if anybody
in the world could find out, “hey, can this help and/or
terrorize me?”

What if your best work could take off, could catch fire, could be everywhere that it could do good or evil?

Immediately?



## Let's Do Some Good And/Or Evil in the World

There are some great “instant deployment” solutions like Heroku, and
my book covers them.  They’re useful.

But there are also deployment solutions which need more
setup.  We’ll go over those too, and when you’ll want or need to
use them.  Puppet, EC2, VPS.

We won’t cover everything.  “Everything” is huge.  But we’ll cover the
a great beginning set of software, and where you go from there.  And
better yet, when you write standard stuff you’ll have a simple,
straightforward way to kick it out the door.

And it’ll run.  And you can send out links to it.  And people can use it.

# Mad Scientists Get What They Want, Or Else

You know what you do.  You know what you want.

So: try this out for six months.  If it’s not what you want, email me
and get a refund.

You’ll have my personal email address.  I read every message you send.

This ebook costs $50 -- for now.  It will get more expensive.  Later,
you’ll probably have to pay some company for hosting (except the
initial free EC2 time).

There will also be interviews and supplemental material —
extra information from people who build a lot of the tools you’ll be
using.  If you buy now, you’ll get a nice discount on those things
later, if you want it.  Or you can wait, and everything gets more
expensive.

The earlier you buy, the more say you get in the material as I write
it.  As with Rebuilding Rails, the pre-orders get you only the early
chapters, and more as I write them.  But I’ll fix errors and expand
things my early readers ask for as I go along.  Want to be one of
those early readers?
