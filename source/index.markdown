Are you just putting it off? Writing more features to avoid facing that next step?

Or you put together a horrible one-off "special snowflake" server, and you hope like
hell it <b>never goes down</b>. You can't build a staging server.

{% imgcap right /images/deploy_tag_cloud.png 350 129 How Many of These Are Required? %}

Or you're installing one more tool and hoping it helps. Please?

You tried. You read through <i>Rails guides,
ancient blog posts</i> and many, many forums of
<b><i>"just rewrite everything in my favorite tool!"</i></b>

Also, most of the blog posts are flat-out wrong. Capistrano 3, Puppet 3, Chef 11,
they all <b>break backward compatibility. A lot.</b> If a blog post is old,
it's wrong. And most of them aren't labeled, and don't say what version.

<b>Or your deploy system mostly works... And then breaks.</b>

You push a new
version out. Things break. You <i><b>hope that nobody notices the downtime</b></i>.

<i>That <b>DREAD</b> when you get ready to deploy, let alone fix a problem on the
server...</i>

How do you find deploy bugs, server config bugs and production-only bugs?



## What If Deploys Just Worked?

{% img pull-right /images/GoogleRubyDeployment.png 270 400 "A familiar sight" "What you see when you start Googling Ruby Deployment" %}

What if deploying your app was easy and reliable? What if you never had
<i>"I'll just fix this quick!"</i> downtime?

What if it was easy to test new versions quietly, then push them
out when they work?

What if you could write a new app and have it <i>up and running the
same day</i> and feel <i>confident that it worked?</i>

## But... How?

Ruby Mad Science is an opinionated application deployment class.
It goes from "only on my machine" to "on the Internet and
anybody can use it."

You get:

<ul>
  <li>Tools that install <b>everything you need</b> locally. Just <b>one</b> download.</li>
  <li>A full development environment set up for you.</li>
  <li>Your application deployed to a virtual machine, then to production.</li>
  <li>Simple instructions to drop your own app in, even if it needs custom libraries. Or servers.</li>
  <li>Solid, simple monitoring for your app</li>
  <li>A pain-free initial process, then troubleshooting and customization when you want.</li>
</ul>

You'll get the "I NEED IT DEPLOYED NOW" fast instructions with minimal theory, <b>plus</b> a
slower path that teaches you what the tools do and why &mdash;
deep knowledge for developers who like to know how everything ticks.

{% blockquote Yehuda Katz, (about <a href="http://rebuilding-rails.com">Rebuilding Rails</a>) %}
I saw your talk at Gogaruco. It was fun!

Your methodology maps onto how I like to learn things: from the ground up from first principles.
{% endblockquote %}

### The Amazing Package

You'll get everything. The class. The code. Free upgrades for life.
All content related to this class, current or future, you will have
full access to.

And you'll have up to 10 hours of my time to help you
through. You can use it at any time in the 12 calendar months
following purchase &mdash; longer if you ask me for an extension.

This is the "concierge service" package. I will work very hard to make you
happy and get your Ruby-Mad-Science-style deployment where it should be.

Yet it costs less than hiring a contractor to set up your
deployment, and much less than hiring a full-time DevOps guy.

Buy <s>now</s>later for: $1999

### The Professional Package

You'll receive the code and the class materials, including every video
tutorial and interview (full details TBA.) You'll receive the code,
licensed for commercial and non-commercial use.

For this and every package, I'll work hard to satisfy you and refund your money
promptly if I can't.

This course costs the equivalent of only 7 hours of fully-loaded
developer time &mdash; or four hours for a DevOps freelancer capable of doing this right.

But don't buy yet! We're still getting a pilot class together! If you want into the pilot class,
please subscribe to the mailing list below &mdash; I'll look for pilot class members from
that list. Thanks!

## Praise for Rebuilding Rails by Noah Gibbs

Rebuilding Rails has been chosen as the subject of a class at the University of Washington,
several different Rails bootcamps and Satish Talim's RubyLearning.com class. It has been
the subject of Ruby conference presentations by Guille Carlos and Nishant Modak,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh5MYvNXt0A" target="_blank">plus my own</a>.

{% blockquote Satish Talim https://www.facebook.com/rubylearning/posts/10151644050623920 RubyLearning.com %}
This is a must-have book for anyone seriously planning to work or working in Sinatra, Rails.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote Eli Riter %}
Okay, damn you, you win!  I'll buy the book: the exercises are just too
good. [...] You write as though your audience has minimal knowledge
and limitless intelligence.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote David Baynes %}
Thanks, Noah! Really jacked to read this highly recommended book by my teachers
at University of Washington.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote Kirk Quesnelle %}
What drew my attention to your book was that [...] I'm the type of
developer that likes to know how things tick at a very deep level.
The guy who messed with Assembler but knew he didn't have to. I'm not a huge
fan of magic when it comes to programming for the fact that when you get
into trouble with code or find yourself in a complex edge case, or even a
bug, knowing more about what's going on "behind the scenes" is very
helpful.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote Brian Cameron %}
I found your book there a while back and finally over Christmas I've had
some time to work through it. It's satisfying a whole load of curiosities
that I had and I'm learning and clarifying a lot of things. In fact, I'm
like a kid in a candy store. It's so nice to be spoon fed this info as
it's a lot of work to dig it out all by oneself.

It was the perfect Christmas present to myself ;-)

Your flow and pedagogic style is just excellent, always dropping in some
neat tricks along side the main topic.
{% endblockquote %}
