Is that Rails app deployed yet? Or are you still waiting and hoping?

If it's just on your dev machine, nobody else ever sees it.

How much of your code never leaves your dev box? "It works on my machine?"

Wasted code. Wasted nights and weekends.

You tried. You Googled "Ruby Deployment." You read through <b><i>weird Rails guides,
out-of-date blog posts</i></b> and many, many forums of <b><i>"why don't you use these
three extra tools?"</i></b>

You set up tools, and tools, and tools. Some of them even worked, though
nothing did what you really wanted.

And of course, <b>your app breaks on most deploys</b>. It seems like every time you push a new
version out, things break and you <i><b>hope that nobody
notices</b></i>.

<i>That <b>DREAD</b> when you get ready to <b>hit "deploy"</b>...</i>

## What If You Knew It Would Just Work?

What if your app just ran and everybody could use it?

What if it was easy to test new versions quietly, then push them
out when they work?

You could test your deployment ahead of time and fix mistakes
<i>before</i> your users saw them &mdash; even deployment bugs.
Even multiprocess bugs, bugs with Unicorn and bugs that only happen with
RAILS_ENV=production.

What if you could write a new app and have it <i>up and running the
same day</i> and feel <i>confident that it worked?</i>

## But... How?

Ruby Mad Science is an opinionated Ruby and Rails deployment class.
It will teach you:

<ul>
  <li>Which tools to use, with full code</li>
  <li>How to set up a development, staging and production environment</li>
  <li>Repeatable deploy tool setup - so your deploy code still works in six months</li>
  <li>Solid, simple monitoring for your app</li>
</ul>

You'll get the "OMG I need it NOW!" fast path with minimal theory, <b>plus</b> a
slower path that teaches you what the tools do and why &mdash;
deep knowledge for developers who like to know how everything ticks.

(I wrote <a href="http://rebuilding-rails.com" target="_blank">Rebuilding Rails</a>,
 I'm all for "deep knowledge" and "how everything ticks".)

## The Blazing Fast Package

(Not available yet. If you want to pay me more, I'll offer a package
 upgrade soon.)

<p class="text-muted">Want it all now, but don't want to learn a ton of theory?
Buy the class, get the exact versions of everything you need, install them, copy the code into place.</p>

<!--
When and <i><b>only if you need it</b></i>, then you can read some troubleshooting guides.

You'll get real working code and all future updates for free.

Get your app working.

Get the class textbook, the videos, the quick-start "Fast Path" guide and my free mini-course on Ruby Concurrency,
all for $349.99.

## The Class Package

Don't need your deploy finished yesterday? Not sure you'll need the extras? Save money with the Class Package.
You'll get the same class textbook
and access to the same source code. But you'll have to download your own tools with the right versions.
Don't worry, they're free online!

Get the class textbook and introductory videos for only $79.99. Upgrade at any time if you need it.

This ebook costs $50 -- for now.  It will get more expensive.  Later,
you’ll probably have to pay some company for hosting (except the
initial free EC2 time).

There will also be interviews and supplemental material —
extra information from people who build a lot of the tools you’ll be
using.  If you buy now, you’ll get a nice discount on those things
later, if you want it.  Or you can wait, and everything gets more
expensive.

The earlier you buy, the more say you get in the material as I write
it.  As with Rebuilding Rails, the pre-orders get you only the early
chapters, and more as I write them.  But I’ll fix errors and expand
things my early readers ask for as I go along.  Want to be one of
those early readers?
