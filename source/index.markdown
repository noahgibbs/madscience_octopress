Or are you trying to install three different tools, and hoping one of them helps?

You tried. You read through <b><i>Rails guides,
ancient blog posts</i></b> and many, many forums of
<b><i>"just switch to my favorite tool!"</i></b>

Also, most of the blog posts are flat-out wrong. Capistrano 3, Puppet 3, Chef 11,
they all <b>break backward compatibility. A lot.</b>

{% imgcap right /images/deploy_tag_cloud.png 350 129 Everything you need to know? %}

<b>Your deploy system mostly works... And then breaks.</b>

You push a new
version out. Things break. You <i><b>hope that nobody notices the downtime</b></i>.

<i>That <b>DREAD</b> when you get ready to deploy, let alone fix a problem on the
server...</i>

How do you find deploy bugs, server config bugs and production-only bugs?



## What If Deploys Just Worked?

{% img pull-right /images/GoogleRubyDeployment.png 270 400 "A familiar sight" "What you see when you start Googling Ruby Deployment" %}

What if deploying your app was easy and reliable? What if you never had
<i>"I'll just fix this quick!"</i> downtime?

What if it was easy to test new versions quietly, then push them
out when they work?

What if you could write a new app and have it <i>up and running the
same day</i> and feel <i>confident that it worked?</i>

## But... How?

Ruby Mad Science is an opinionated Ruby and Rails deployment class.
It will teach you:

<ul>
  <li>Which tools to use, with full code</li>
  <li>How to set up a development, staging and production environment</li>
  <li>Repeatable deploy tool setup - so your deploy code still works in six months</li>
  <li>Solid, simple monitoring for your app</li>
</ul>

You'll get the "OMG I need it NOW!" fast instructions with minimal theory, <b>plus</b> a
slower path that teaches you what the tools do and why &mdash;
deep knowledge for developers who like to know how everything ticks.
